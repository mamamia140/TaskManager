# TaskManager üìù

**TaskManager** is a simple command-line application that allows you to manage your tasks easily via commands like **add**, **list**, **remove**, and **modify**.

You can create, view, update, and delete your tasks, which are stored persistently in a JSON file.

I created this project to **improve my self in TDD (Test-Driven Development)**, following a strict write-tests-first approach.
